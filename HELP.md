# Help

This is a webapp for the trying out an AI Deck for the Marvel Crisis Protocol miniatures/skirmish game. AI Cards are pulled randomly from a deck of 16 cards with varying actions in an if-else structure. 

Each opposing side's models acts as Life Model Decoys (LMDs for short) in Marvel lore. On every LMD activation, draw a card and follow the card's text for its activation this round. 

Actions taken by the AI (still) follows the 2 actions per activation rule from the Marvel Crisis Protocol rulebook.

Try this LMD Deck out with the *Ultron, Master of Metal Ultimate Encounter* event from AMG's website.

### Card sections
- **Targets of Opportunity** - are potential targets for the actions the LMD is going to take this turn. It can be a player model, objective/token, or terrain feature depending on the objectives or scenarios.   
- **Actions** - are in-game turn action(s) for a model to do. If the LMD cannot do an action listed, move on to the next action in order and so on. If a selecting an "attack type" for an attack action, select the appropriate defense stat of the target.   
- **\[ ! \]** - are actions taken usually when attacked and will react with an appropriate superpower when able.   
- **\[ ? \]** - are default basic actions if a model cannot do any of the listed actions in the previous sections and/or still have an action left in its activation.

### Additional rules
- **Move** - LMD will use its full movement (S, M, L) to the target, going around or on top of terrain features when applicable.
- **Objective** - Unless the card says so, LMD will move and try to contest an objective and/or activate when appropriate.   
- **(Superpower)** - LMD uses a superpower when able; or attacks with a 0-cost attack.   
- **(Superpower/Throw)** - LMD uses a superpower with throw; or attacks with a 0-cost attack.   
- **(Cover)** - LMD moves towards a terrain feature and uses cover when able.   
- Have dice ready for any random selection.   
- Always rule to the LMD's favour.   

# Variants
**Danger Room** - All targets by the LMD's attacks will use lowest defense stat of the players character. This simulates the hero (or villain) in a training facility and are a bit relaxed.
